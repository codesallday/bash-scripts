Bash Scripts for Ubuntu
========================

These are just Bash scripts for painless setup of some software under Ubuntu.

```sh
./dev_install.sh      # for Node, Ruby, Sublime & more
./extra_install.sh    # for XBMC and Spotify
```

To execute the Mac script directly:

    bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unRARed/bash-scripts/master/mac_install.sh)

This will probably also work for the Ubuntu script, but haven't tested.
